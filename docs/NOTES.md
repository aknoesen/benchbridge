### Two DACs — expose W2 as its own generator instrument
The real M2K has **two arbitrary-waveform outputs, W1 and W2** (two DACs). The twin currently
exposes only **W1** as a Signal Generator instrument (`params`). W2 exists in the model as the
second generator (`params2` / `generator2`) and as the schematic **W2 port** (awg2 → net `in2`,
stamped by `applyGeneratorParams`), but it is only editable indirectly through the Oscilloscope's
CH2 controls and the Spectrum's CH2 controls.

Idea: give W2 a first-class generator UI so it is independently controllable like the real bench.
Options:
- A second **Signal Generator** instrument (W2) in the nav, OR
- A **two-channel Signal Generator** panel (W1 + W2), matching how Scopy presents the AWG.

Plumbing already exists (`params2`, `applyGeneratorParams` handles `W2`), so this is mostly UI:
a generator panel bound to `params2` / `setParams2`, plus a nav entry. Low risk, no signal-math
change. Would let students drive a circuit with two independent sources (e.g. differential or
two-tone inputs).
